Multivariate polynomial Cryptography (Rainbow) , Isogeny-based Cryptography (SIKE)

Using a completely new quantum encryption algorithm rather increases the attack surface and increases the likelihood of exposure to other vulnerabilities.

Existing encryption standard algorithms that have undergone sufficient combat testing and security verification are safer in these situations.

Therefore, instead of the incomplete NIST candidate quantum encryption algorithm, we have adopted the simplest and easiest approach to a more secure structure, using existing encryption protocols that are most secure from other attacks.

The encryption standard and officially recognized AES-256 algorithm is difficult to decrypt even supercomputers or quantum computers,
We want to develop a safer structure while using this algorithm.

There is currently no algorithm, such as AES-512, that is more powerful than AES-256; however, we use the key derived from the existing AES-256 algorithm in a safer structure, and this technique is as difficult to decrypt as AES-512.

I think it will probably take more than 50 years with a quantum computer to decrypt a file encrypted by this cryptographic structure.
